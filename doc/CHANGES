Changed in ATK 5.5.1
--------------------
+ Added atkMessageQueue for user notification messages, which can be shown
  via the atkmessages plugin. [Patrick]  
+ Added atkCalculatorAttribute for adding columns with calculated values. [Ivo]
* Introduced atkeditlng which can be passed along to force ML attributes to
  display a specific language. [Boy]

  of post and get vars. Several methods from atkNode have been moved to this
  class. Most importantly, methods for dispatching, page rendering and url
  creating are moved. [Maurice]

  or a specific param when a key is given as parameter. [Maurice]
* Some functional decomposition of atkSaveHandler [Maurice]
* Added the ability to override an actionHandler class in function 
  atkNode::callHandler. [Maurice]
* Added notification for trigger events (eg preAdd, postAdd). [Maurice]

  to string value. [Maurice]
+ Added to possibility to override a atkController class in atkNode. [Maurice]
* Added dipatchUrl method to atkController. This function should be used by
  other classes get the url to redirect to or when creating links. [Maurice]
* When running into errors on admin and add pages, the error was shown on an
  add page. We now detirmine if we should show an add or admin page. [Maurice]

  possible to retrieve values from other stack levels as the current one. 
  [Maurice]
+ Added finish functionality to atkWizard and renamed start() method to 
  execute(). [Maurice]

  create a function named <attribname>_selection($record, $mode) in
  your node and return the selectable records. [Peter]

Changes in ATK 5.5
------------------

  does, but with the ability to disable the sending of e-mails (and in the
  future send e-mails to other addresses etc.) for debugging purposes. [Peter]
+ Added support for configuration file overrides by other sections. [Peter]
+ Made atkErrorHandler put notices and php5 strict errors into the atk debug
  log so developers can see them. [Guido]
+ Added validate() method to atkDateTimeAttribute so both the date and time
  parts can be validated upon input. [Lineke]
+ Flags for the atkDateTimeAttribute are now also passed to its internal
  atkDateAttribute and the atkTimeAttribute. [Lineke]
+ Added setForceUpdate() method to atkAttribute to force update of its value
  upon save. [Boy]
+ Added 'mock' database drivers for testing purposes. [Boy]
+ Added atkMockNode to emulate a node, for testing purposes. [Ivo]
+ Added atkTestCase baseclass for unittests, that features the ability to
  replace database connections, nodes and the securitymanager with mock
  objects. [Ivo, Boy]

  tab of a node. [Harrie]
+ Added atkSetNode() counterpart for atkGetNode(), to set nodes to a different
  instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added atkSetSecurityManager() counterpart for atkGetSecurityManager(), to set
  the securitymanager to a different instance at runtime. [Ivo]

  link which can be used to add records to the referenced node (if the user
  is allowed to do so). [Guido]
+ Added translations for critical and unknown errors. [Guido]
+ Added convenience methods text() to atkNode and atkAttribute. [Ivo, Peter]
+ Added $config["automenu"] for meta module. If set to false, the meta module
  does not add any default menuitems. Defaults to true. [Ivo]
+ atkNode now has built-in detection of trigger reruns, so even if triggers
  such as postAdd are called twice, it only runs on the first call. [Ivo]
+ Added $config_auth_changerealm to influence whether http authentication
  should change its realm to allow logout. [ChristianH, Ivo]
+ Added the ability to reset a database connection. [Boy]
* The atkNode constructor's $type parameter is now optional and defaults to
  the class name. [Ivo]

  if not present. Minimum requirement is now PHP 4.1. [Guido]
* Code improvement of pre/post triggers. Also preAdd() is now properly called
  from the addDb() method. [Martin]
* Moved the modifier calling functionality to atkModule. This makes it
  possible to implement a generic modifier in a module that can handle any
  node from any module. [Ivo, Guido]
* If an action has no html output, the dispatcher no longer renders an html
  page. This reduces some overhead on output-less actions such as save/update/
  delete. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the search functionality of the atkManyBoolRelation. [Stefano]
* Fixed translation for the title of the 'select' action. [Lineke]
* Passed along atkprevlevel to debugger window so the stack doesn't get forked
  causing the console window to draw a blank page. [Boy]
* If no link_select_node translation is found atkManyToOneRelation tries a
  generic translation of 'select_a' followed by the node name. [Boy]
* If no title_module translation is found, atkProfileAttribute will use
  the module name itself as translation. [Ivo]
* If extended searching is called directly the resultlist is nested in the
  session so after editing we return directly to the results. [Boy]
* atkTimeAttribute now properly distinguishes between '0:00' hours and empty
  values. [Ivo]
* Fixed a stylesheet problem when using Internet Explorer; the font size and
  color of clickable recordlist headers would change when hovering over them
  with the mousepointer. [Guido]
* Fixed a bug in atkAtttribute's setTabs() method. [Peter]
* getNode() is now called atkGetNode to be more consistent with naming
  convention. (getNode() is still present as deprecated function). [Ivo]
* Bugfix in atkListAttribute: All quotes in options are now replaced with
  &quot;. [Lineke]
* Bugfix in atkMultiSelectattribute: always add escapeSql to value in
  checkbox. [Lineke]
* The 'view' action now uses atkNode's getFormButtons() method to get the
  appropriate buttons. [Lineke]
* Fixed a bug when hiding an atkBoolAttribute. [Lineke]
* When a new search is performed in a recordlist, the screen now jumps to
  the first page. [Lineke]
* Fixed several issues in LDAP authentication. [Lineke]
* Added the ability to add additional headers to a page rendered with atkPage.
  [Lineke]
* Fixed a Smarty regular expression to support '0 params'. [Lineke]
* Fixed a bug in Smarty's core.read_cache_file.php. More information:
  http://www.phpinsider.com/smarty-forum/viewtopic.php?t=4188&highlight=
  smartytplfunc. [Lineke]
* Fixed AF_UNIQUE check in atkNodeValidator (used postvars instead of record
  for validation). [Peter]
* Fixed some outlook tree icons that were corrupted. [Lineke]
* Recordlist icon names are now assumed to be lowercase. [Ivo]
* atkTheme attributes are now case insensitive. [Ivo]
* atkOneToManyRelation now builds the referential where clause in a separate
  overridable method _getLoadWhereClause(). [Ivo]
* Using single quotes in smarty tags is now allowed. [Lineke]
* Fixed security issue in atkProfileAttribute. Users can no longer grant
  privileges they don't have themeselves. [Harrie, Guido]
* atkNode::getTabs can now handle actions without tabs. [Ivo]
* Cleaned up the atkSecurityManager constructor. [Ivo]
* atkManyToOneRelation now uses primary key field as default order if no order
  was specified. [Lineke]
* The edit screen now remembers the tab the user was on for the current record
  (used to be record-independent). [Lineke]
* Fixed translation of atkDateAttribute when the current language was changed
  at runtime. [Ivo]
* Fixed memory leak with debugger set at level 2 where session would be
  stuffed with debug data. [Boy,Sandy]
* Reduced memory consumption of traces by replacing &nbsp; with plain space
  as the preformat tag already takes care of proper formatting. [Guido]
* Fixed html tag delimiters ('<' and '>') in traces being interpreted
  by the browser when present in atk_get_trace("html") output. Now they
  are replaced by html entities (&gt; and &lt; respectively). [Guido]
* Fixed various javascript errors related to showtab which sometimes
  resulted in all tabs being displayed as active. [Guido]
* Fixed cross-browser cursor behaviour when hovering over tabs. [Guido]
* Upgraded tbsooo opendocument parser from version 0.7.7 to 0.7.8. [Guido]

Note: The CHANGES file has not been accurately updated until the release of
ATK 5.0. The changes below are rough feature indications.

Changes in ATK 4.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 4 was the PHP4 release of ATK. The light version was the version that has
accompanied Achievo (http://www.achievo.org) from approx. 0.6 to 1.1, and was
not publically available outside of Achievo. A detailed changelog has not
been kept. Most changes can be traced back to entries in Achievo's CHANGES
file.

Changes in ATK 3.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 3 was the first publicly available release, but only as part of
Achievo. based on PHP3. All was new, so a list of changes is not present.
