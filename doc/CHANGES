Changes in ATK 5.3RC2
---------------------

Changes in ATK 5.3RC1
---------------------
+ Added support for the atkMetaNode to the Oracle (OCI) driver. [Peter]
+ Added support for default values to the atkMetaNode (only numerics and
  strings at this time and only on PostgreSQL and Oracle). [Peter]
+ Added relation support to the atkMetaPolicy (supports one-to-one,
  one-to-many and many-to-one relations). [Peter]
+ Added get/setDescriptorTemplate methods to atkNode and atkRelation. [Peter]
+ Added get/setDestinationFilter methods to atkRelation. [Peter]
+ Added getInstance() for the atkMlSplitter class. [Martin]
+ Added nodeExists method to atkModule. At this time only used by
  atkMetaPolicy relation support. [Peter]
+ Added atkMetaTools class which contains methods to singularize or pluralize
  English strings (e.g. dogs => dog, dog => dogs etc.). [Peter]
+ Added AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED, this causes the add to be embedded in the current
  node, instead of displaying it on a seperate screen. [Boy]
+ Added $config_javascript_confirmation, setting this to true will make ATK
  use javascript for the confirmation dialogue when deleting. [Boy]
+ Added NF_CACHE_RECORDLIST which makes ATK cache all the recordlists. [Boy]
+ Added $format parameter to func_datetochar. [Ivo]
+ Added vendorDateFormat method to abstraction layer for database specific
  date formatting strings. [Ivo]
+ Added atkLiveTextPreview attribute to preview html content of atkAttributes
  and atkTextAttributes in realtime. [Ivo]
+ Made it possible to pass size to atkFileWriterAttribute. [Boy]
+ Added function atk_in_array_recursive($needle, $haystack) which is similar
  to php's in_array, only this one is recursive. [Dennis-Jan]
+ Made atkTimeAttribute work with a time string from the postvars. [Boy]
+ Added a $config_auth_userfk config option to configure the name of the
  foreign keys pointing to the usertable. [MartinL]

  longer than what is valid for a filename. [Ivo]
+ Added addDynamicFunction to atkSmarty for easier registration of plugins
  that should not be cached. [Ivo]
+ Added multiple named db connections ability. Note that this requires a
  change in all config.inc.php files. See atk/skel/config.inc.php for
  examples. [Ivo]
+ Added atkTmpFile for easier manipulation of temporary files. [Ivo, Sandy]
+ Added support for preloading only certain parts of a module using a
  module_preload.inc file. If this file exists it will be loaded instead of
  module.inc and module.inc will only be loaded once a call to getModule(...)
  has been made. NOTE: this means modules are *not* loaded in the global space
  anymore! [Peter]
+ Added getNameSpace() to atkSessionManager. [Ivo]
+ Added ucfirst(string) to javascript/tools.js. [Boy]
+ Added $config_list_obligatory_null_item to add a 'None' item to dropdowns
  even when obligatory (forces the user to choose). Can be disabled per
  individual atkListAttribute with AF_LIST_NO_OBLIGATORY_NULL_ITEM. [Bas, Ivo]
+ atkListAttribute now supports custom onChange javascript code. [Boy]
+ Added config variable 'tplusesubdirs' to use subdirectories with the
  smarty's cached and compiled templates. [Martin]

  expanding/collapsing [Wouter]

  set $config_language_module_fallback to true for all calls to search all the
  modules for a string. [Boy]
+ Added $config_corporate_node_base and $config_corporate_module_base for
  defining application wide custom baseclasses for nodes and modules. [Ivo]
+ Added atkConfig::get() for retrieving config values by section. Variables
  can be defined as $config["value"] in configs/<section>.inc.php files. [Ivo]
+ $config values can now be redirected to a runtime function by defining
  a function called config_<configkey>() or config_<modname>_<configkey>() for
  modules. [Ivo]
+ Added debug console for debugging queries. Shows explain plan, results and
  backtrace for each query performed on a page (mysql only currently).
  If debuglevel is 2, a stacktrace of each debug statement is shown. [Ivo]
+ Debug output now includes memory usage information and elapsed time between
  two atkdebug calls. [Ivo]
+ Added setWidth() and getWidth() function to atkListAttribute to set the
  width of dropdown list in pixels. [Boy]

  current database to atkDb class. [Peter]

  (NF_ADD_LINK). [Martin]
* Fixed translation for multi record actions. [Martin]
* Introduced db member variable for atkQuery which is needed when using
  multiple connections. [Harrie, Boy]

Note: The CHANGES file has not been accurately updated until the release of
ATK 5.0. The changes below are rough feature indications.

Changes in ATK 4.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 4 was the PHP4 release of ATK. The light version was the version that has
accompanied Achievo (http://www.achievo.org) from approx. 0.6 to 1.1, and was
not publically available outside of Achievo. A detailed changelog has not
been kept. Most changes can be traced back to entries in Achievo's CHANGES
file.

Changes in ATK 3.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 3 was the first publicly available release, but only as part of
Achievo. based on PHP3. All was new, so a list of changes is not present.
