Changed in ATK 5.7
------------------
* AtkMlWrapper attribute clone fix: check phpversion and use right clone 
  method based on this (check http://www.acko.net/node/54) [Nico]
* AtkMlWrapper getRecordForLng fix: first check if record is empty [Nico]
+ Added m_displayShowAll var to atknavigator, so you can configure if you
  want to show the 'show all' link in the navigation [Wim,Nico]
+ Devided render part in the atkrecordlist class into a specific render 
  part and a part which collects all needed data for rendering. 
  This way it's easy to display a recordlist in a different layout. [wim]
+ Added pre-action support in atkNode and atkActionListener classes. [patrick]
+ Added support to the LDAP authentication class for searching in 
  multiple locations (DN's) instead of one base DN as it was previously
  [Wim].
+ Added function checkKeyDimension() in the atkManyToManyRelation class
  to fix a problem with local / remote keys being a multi-dimensional
  array which resulted in invalid queries (mostly occurred in
  combination with atkmanyboolrelation / atkshuttlerelation). [Wim]
+ Added the function getAttributes to get all the attributes of a node in
  an array. [Dennis-Jan]
+ Added {atkscript} Smarty plug-in (can be used to register a JavaScript
  file from within a template). [Peter]
+ Added {atkdatefield} Smarty plug-in (can be used to embed date controls
  in pages, based on the atkDateAttribute). [Peter]
+ Added {atkthemeimg} Smarty plug-in (can be be used to retrieve the path of
  theme images). [Ivo]
+ Added addOverloader, removeOverloader and hasOverloader functions
  to atktools so overloaders can be added realtime instead of only in the
  module_preload. [Boy]
+ Added the ability to use a bracket-template in the value for default values
  in the atkImportHandler. [Ivo]
+ Added functionalitiy to atkOpenDocumentWriter to support styles in tags of
  generated documents. Html styles are converted to XML: bold, italic and
  underline are supported (any combination is possible with IE-generated html;
  for now, only the italic/bold combination is supported for FireFox-generated
  html code). [Jeroen]
+ Added JSON serialization/deserialization support, available as static
  methods of class atk.utils.atkJSON and available as Smarty modifier. [Peter]
+ atkButton now takes an optional parameter '$cssclass' that sets the css
  class for the button. [Harrie]
+ Added include/exclude parameters to atkNode::updateDb. [Peter]
+ DocumentWriter: convert Html bullets (fck-editor) to XML (tab + *)
  Only 1 level deep supported (deeper levels in html will be converted to
  level 1 in the generated document) [Jeroen]
+ Added function assignRecordByNodeAndSelector($nodename, $selector,
  $prefix = "") in atkDocumentWriter to allow a record to be assigned to the
  document by just supplying the nodename and selector as strings. This
  eliminates the need to do the atkGetNode, selectDb and
  assignDocumentSingleRecord calls over and over again. [Guido]
+ Added a space between the hours and minutes dropdown box of an
  atkDurationAttributes edit output. [Guido]
+ Added AF_PASSWORD_NO_ENCODE flag for atkPasswordAttribute, allows you
  to disable the encoding of passwords using the md5 algorithm. Moved
  the encoding also to a separate method (encode) which allows the
  use of different algorithms. [Peter]
+ Added getDb method to atkAttribute (retrieves the db instance from
  the owner instance with a fallback to the default db instance). [Peter]
+ Added escapeSQL method to atkAttribute (uses the correct database
  instead of the default database). [Peter]
+ Added support for many-to-many relations to atkMetaPolicy. Example:
  $policy->hasMany('people', array('through' => 'organisations_people'));
  By default the shuttle relation will be used, you can specify type
  bool(ean) in the options array for a many-bool relation. [Peter]
+ Added achievo_modern theme. [Norman,Boy]
+ Added selectable records override to atkManyBoolRelation and
  atkShuttleRelation. Usage: create a function named
  <attribname>_selection($record, $mode) in your node and return
  the selectable records. [Peter]
+ Added AF_MANYTOONE_LAZY flag to atkManyToOneRelation, this flag makes it
  possible to lazy load a many-to-one record in list mode. This is needed
  for example if your destination node uses a different database. [Bart,Peter]
+ Added some unittests. (bug #615) [Yury]
+ Added display function for fck attribute to prevent html tags from being 
  encoded. [Guido]
+ Added missing include in atkManyToOneTreeRelation. [Guido]
+ Added atkIpAttribute for entering ip's (optionally with wildcards). [Peter]
+ Added atkGetClientIp() function for retrieving the client's ip address, this
  includes a check for webservers behind a load balancer etc. [Peter]
+ Made atkinstance() resolve the classname before using it, thereby enabling
  the use of overloaders for ATK singletons. [Boy]    
+ atkFileAttribute: File mangling template can now reference all fetched
  values. Added support for <fieldname>_filename magic method in owner node
  to generate custom filenames. [Peter]

+ Added new 'basic' theme, which is completely layoutless, and as much 
  html-table-less as possible (mostly divs and spans). It is intended as a new
  basetheme (instead of the 'default' theme). Derived themes can be completely
  styled using CSS. [Ivo]
+ Added setMasterNode()/getMasterNode() to atkRecordList. This enables 
  rendering of the recordlist of node X inside an action of node Y. [Ivo]
+ Modules can now provide a custom recordlist.tpl or .css. (bug #718) [Yury]
+ Recordlist navigation now contains a summary showing current records and
  total number of records ('Record 26-50 out of 261'). (bug #710) [Yury, Ivo]
+ Added support for atkTimeAttribute in atkImportHandler. [Dennis]

  enable AF_MANYTOONE_LAZY and return the selected record. [Peter]
+ Added true test database support incl. support for fixtures. [Rene,Peter]
* When updateDb fails it has to return false in stead of true. [dennisjan]
* Bugfix in atknode, atkmlsplitter and atkManyToOneRelation
  (m_joinaliases removed from the code) [Sandy, Peter]
* Bugfix in atkImportHandler (in_array takes 2 params, not 1). [Harrie]
* Fixed minor html/4.01 transitional compatibility issue in atkPage. [Guido]
* A password should only be generated if a username is given. [Guido]
* Added the auth_enablepasswordmailer var to the template so login,tpl
  can now detect if it should show the Password forgotten button. [Guido]
* Replaced tbsooo's meth_misc_alert calls by atkerror statements to
  improve debugging. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in tbsooo which caused the SaveXmlToDoc function to fail due to
  the -u option in the zip command (thanks Dennis-Jan for pointing me into
  this direction). [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atkMssqlQuery, it no longer has an ambiguous column error
  when fields in an atkManyToOneRelation have the same name as fields in
  the master node. [Ivo]
* Fixed the atkFormatAttribute, it can now handle multiple delimiters. [Ivo]
* When encountering data that doesn't match the format in atkFormatAttribute,
  the expected format is now displayed in the error message. [Ivo]
* Fixed the login image of the macoslike theme. [Ivo]
* Bugfix: filenames need to be escaped before they are added to the db in
  the atkFileAttribute. [Sandy]
* When an atkFileAttribute is obligatory but somehow empty and no new file
  is uploaded, but an existing file is selected, the atkFileAttribute won't
  ignore this selection anymore. [Guido]
* The atkThemeCompiler should not attempt to compile a theme without the
  required themedef.inc file or without any files at all. [Guido]
* Errors shown above the debug log now also use the monospace font. [Guido]
* Entering a level in the sessionstack more than 1 level above the current
  stack top is now prevented by changing the level to the
  currenttoplevel + 1. This solves the occurance of mislocated stack data
  and/or stack gaps in this scenario. [Guido]
* The atkImportHandler would hide attributes that don't use addToQuery, but
  as long as they properly handle parseStringValue, they are usable, so this
  restriction is removed. [Ivo]
* Multilanguage splitter now also works for the atkMetaManyToOneRelation. [Boy]
* Made debugger pass atkLevel() as prevlevel to debug window, thereby
  making it more likely to show debugging, although still not 100%. [Boy]
* Performed some functional decomposition on atkOutput, adding the
  getDebugging and sendCachingHeaders methods. [Boy]
* Fixed PHP5 issue in Smarty Compiler (block functions). [Peter]
* The exportFile function now also sends content description, transfer 
  encoding and content length headers. It also automatically detects the 
  correct mime type and sends that as a header. [Boy]
* Fixed notices in meta relations, grammar and policy. [Boy]
* atkMetaPolicy now detects presence of 'is_' and 'has_ ' in fieldnames and
  automatically creates relationships. [Boy]
* atkMetaPolicy now by default makes integers with a length of 1 use the
  atkBoolAttribute, and fields named 'country' use the atkCountryAttribute. 
  [Boy]
* atkMetaNodes with an NF_ML flag now automatically have an 
  atkMlSelectorAttribute. [Boy]
* Made ATK ignore select queries that are built with an empty fieldset. [Boy]
* Made ATK force quoting of field names that are reserved names
  like 'from'. [Boy]
* Fixed adding of extension after 'file mangle' of atkFileAttribute. [Boy]
* Performed functional decomposition on atkDateAttribute, adding following
  methods to API: setFormatEdit, setFormatView, setDateMax, setDateMin. [Boy]
* Replaced unused default config 'javascript_confirmation' with:
  'recordlist_javascript_delete'. [Boy]
* Made embedded mode of atkOneToManyRelation work with multilanguage nodes. 
  [Boy]
* Decomposed getting of HTML for embedded buttons of atkOneToManyRelation
  to _getEmbeddedButtons. [Boy]
* Fixed PHP notices and a warning in atkDateAttribute. [Guido]
* Fixed incorrect language identifier date_invalid (should be
  error_date_invalid) in atkDateAttribute. [Guido]
* The restrictions that apply to an atkPasswordAttribute should only be
  tested when a new password was entered. [Guido]
* Improved debugging and error handling in atkOpenDocumentWriter->store()
  function. [Guido]
* Only relevant attributes should be loaded/updated when generating/mailing
  a new password. [Guido]
* Added JavaScript based listener support for atkDateAttributes. [Peter]
* Added support for modifying the date range (minimum / maximum)
  of an atkDateAttribute using JavaScript. [Peter]
* Improved atkDateAttribute / calendar integration (calendar now knows
  everything it needs to know to adjust the field boxes). [Peter]
* Because the FCK editor does not always agree with tabbing and no longer
  becomes editable if you switch (only in firefox), a custom method is added
  to enable all fck-editors. [Jeroen]
* Added name element in FckEditor-code so that we can access the frame from 
  the parent (code change request emailed to fckeditor.net) [Jeroen]
* Performed functional decomposition on atkAdminHandler's adminPage method,
  rendering of admin recordlist is now done by renderAdminList method. [Boy]
* If recordlist does not have any actions available, the action column in
  the recordlist is now no longer shown. [Boy]
* Made atkQuery::create() return query object instantiated with atknew
  instead of with a normal 'new', making it possible to call it without
  first importing the query class. [Boy]
* Made atkNodeValidator use the query object of unique fieldset validation
  instead of doing a hardcoded query thus making it quote reserved names. [Boy]
* The atkFileAttribute now uses 'filename' in display instead of 'orgfilename'
  which caused the strange behaviour of still showing the file you had just
  deleted until you went out of edit mode for the record and back again. [Boy]
* If there are only 2 supported languages or less, atkMlSelectorAttribute 
  hides itself. [Ivo]
* When you remove a file when the atkFileAttribute has the AF_FILE_NO_SELECT
  flag, the file will now no longer be displayed in admin pages. [Dennis-Jan]
* Loading of tabs when the first tab is not the selected one is now smoother.
  [Jeroen, Ivo]
* Fixed a lot of multi-database issues. [Peter]
* Debugger now directly looks at $_REQUEST['atkstackid'] instead of
  atkStackId() (fixes issue with lost debugger data). [Peter]
* Fixed obligatory check in metadata of oci8/9 database driver. [Peter]
* Fixed relation detection in atkOneToOneRelation. [Peter]
* Properly initialize attributes in atkMLSplitter (set owner instance
  and call init method). [Peter]
* Moved required-image from handler to template ({$field.obligatory}).
  Note that custom 'editform.tpl' templates should take this into account.
  [Ivo]
* Fixed use of cache id in delete method of atkOneToOneRelation. [Boy]
* Made atkMultiSelectAttribute's db2value method return an empty array when
  there is no value instead of an array with 1 empty value. [Boy]
* Made it possible to specify top frame height and menu frame width in themes
  with the 'frame_top_height' and 'frame_menu_width' attributes in the
  themedefinition. [Boy]
* Made app.php check wether a menu exists before attempting to instantiate 
  it, if it does not exist it throws an error and renders a plain menu. [Boy]
* Fixed broken preUpdate call in updateDb (preUpdate was called after
  the update query was already created). [Peter]
* Fixed saving 0 value in atkNumberAttribute as 0 instead of NULL. [Peter]
* Removed edit/delete actions in the atkFileEditor when a file isn't
  writable. [Sandy]
* Don't add link surrounding e-mail adres if mode is "csv" in display function
  of atkEmailAttribute. [Peter]
* atkTotalizer now adds subtotals for all subtotalfields when it's the last 
  record. [Sandy]
* atkOneToOneRelation: when destination record already exists, do not create a
  new row in destinationrecord [Ivo, Jeroen]
* atkOneToOneRelation now respects AF_HIDE_LIST flag if AF_ONETOONE_INTEGRATE
  flag is set. Properly prefix row attribute names for list view to prevent
  overwriting columns from the master node. [Peter]
* Search API improvements: Refactored atkNode search conditions to
  applySearchConditions() method, cleaned up some search code, made every
  column in list mode have its own search method. [Ivo]
* atkNode's setIndex method now also works on atkManyToOneRelations (uses the
  descriptor to match the alphabet). [Ivo]
* atkFileAttribute: Silently ignore that a file has already been removed when 
  the AF_FILE_PHYSICAL_DELETE flag is set. [Peter]
* Tbsooo converted apostrophe (&apos; -> \') from XML file for TBS functions.
  This causes corrupt document: convert it back to &apos; in documentwriter 
  [Jeroen]
* Fixed problem with tabs which caused 1:1 relation tabs not to be shown. 
  [Peter]
* Performance: fixed unnecessary instantiation of 1:1 relation destinations. 
  [Peter]

  $config_debug_translations to enable them. [Peter]
* Changed hardcoded 'userid' to use auth_userfield config in reloadUser method
  of atkSecurityManager. [Boy]
* Updated prototype and scriptaculous to latest stable version. [Lineke]
* atkFileAttribute: fixed bug in atkFileAttribute; if AF_OBLIGATORY and
  AF_FILE_NO_SELECT flags where both set you always had to upload a new
  image. [Bart, Peter]
* atkProfileAttribute now uses getUser() instead of $g_user global. [Boy, Ivo]
* Fixed error when calling text() on an attribute that isn't added to a
  node yet. [Guido]
* Fixed problem when adding styles to old sxw format documents in 
  atkOpenDocumentWriter. [Guido]
* the atkPopup target should be passed through session_url in case the
  sessionid is passed through urls. [Guido]
* If $_SESSION[atkconfig("identifier")] is not an array, we assign an empty
  array to it to prevent session initialisation errors. [Peter, Guido]
* Fixed obligatory field checking for attributes of the atkOneToOnerelation's
  destination node by merging the validation errors from the destination
  node with the ownerinstance's errors right after performing the
  validation. [Guido]
* Fixed sudden resize of editarray when the colorpicker gets focussed
  and unfocussed in the Outlook theme. [Guido]
* Fixed style problem where the first column would be stretched to almost
  the full pagewidth, while other columns need that space much more than
  the first column. [Guido]
* Fixed a problem where attributes whould be hidden from a list because 
  atkNode falsely determines you do not have the tab rights needed to see 
  those attributes. (bug #615) [Yury]
* Fixed performance problem due to incorrect selectDb parameter in
  atkExportHandler. [Guido]
* Fixed several PHP Notices. [Guido]
* Added ability to implement a getExportAttributeGroup($attrname) function
  in a node to implement custom grouping in atkExportHandler. [Guido]

  surrounded by quotes. Also added some fixes for invalid quotes surrounding
  attribute names. [Peter]

  if no records are found. [Bart]
* Fixed support for atkDateTimeAttribute in oci8 driver. (bug #596) [Renato]

* Fixed 'Content-Type' header in exportFile() method, so browsers can 
  determine the correct file type when downloading/opening. [Jeroen]
* atkDocumentWriter: Convert bullets to ' -' (tabs mess up layout), add extra 
  line after starting,bullet-list, replace bold and italic tags within 
  <li></li>. [Jeroen]

  form element, instead of a somewhat guess). [Peter]
* Fixed support for returning the newly created record for a many-to-one
  relation even after an edit-after-add action has been performed. [Peter]
* Added $mergeSelectors parameter to atkNode::confirmAction (defaults to
  true to be backwards compatible). [Peter] 
* Use select mode for retrieval of records for atkManyToOneRelation. [Peter]
* Fetch descriptor fields early for atkManyToOneRelation so that they can
  be displayed in the title bar etc. [Dennis,Peter]
* A table cell can now have a Row and Col Span in the 
  atkTableRenderer. [Sandy]
* Bug fix, if going from edit mode to view for the same record the current tab
  is only shown if it still exists in edit mode. [Dennis,Peter]
* Bug fix, handle saved form data at the session manager level instead on
  a lower level (which caused all sorts of problems, e.g. forgotten data,
  data that shouldn't be there etc.). [Dennis,Peter]
* If add handler is called directly the user can return to a new add form
  after saving the first one. [Dennis,Peter]
* Properly handle attribute postvars in add, save, edit and update handler
  after getting back from for example the select handler. [Dennis,Peter]
* Removed dirty hack from atkManyToOneRelation for the return value of
  the select handler (select link) or add handler (add link). This hack
  still exists for the classic AF_LARGE mode. [Dennis,Peter]
* In advanced search labels are always shown (before AF_NO_LABEL was used to
  determine if a label should be shown). [Lineke]
* Made the new 'modern' menu the default menu in new installations. [Boy]
* Fixed: Open Office document generator. On some systems unzip and zip would 
  return -1 instead of 0 on succesfull completion. However, no actual 
  information found on the internet to back this up). [Dennis, Guido]
* Importhandler now uses charset from languagefiles to convert the importedfile
  to the correct charset. [Lineke]
* Fixed some tests. [Sandy]
* Tests are only harvested in the testcases directory. [Sandy] 
* Moved atkselector from the default sessionmembers to the pagevars as it 
  should not be propagated to deeper session levels. [dennisjan]
* Added ability to pass default to getAttribute method of atkTheme and made
  atkTheme search for icons with extension .png and .jpeg too, preferring
  png over gif and gif over jpeg. [Boy]
* Made atkPage output XHTML valid, made ATK support themes defining the doctype
  as a theme attribute, made ATK support a page.tpl, which is a general template
  to render a page in. [Boy]
* Made login page use login.css if available and made login form more 
  XHTML compliant. [Boy]
* Added loadDispatch method to atkNode, which loads the output in atkOutput
  but doesn't actually flush anything and make it support a dispatch.tpl
  template if available. [Boy]
* Made index.php support themes with 'useframes' attribute (defaults to true), 
  loading themes with this attribute set to false without frames,
  please update your index.php from atk/skel/index.php. [Boy]
* atkPlainMenu now supports themes and configurations which set a different
  'menufile' (defaults to menu.php) and different 'menu_params' 
  (defaults to 'target="main"'). [Boy]
* atkPlainMenu now has getMenu member function which returns the menu without
  sending it to the output stream. [Boy]
* Made url functions session_vars and session_url output &amp; instead of &
  to ensure XHTML compliance. [Boy]
* Added atkGetModules() function. [Jeroen,Boy]
* Exporthandler now decodes export to charset in languagefile. Added parameter
  to customrecordlist to set decoding on or off. [Lineke]
* Showtitlerow checkbox is now taken into account in customrecordlist. Added
  parameter to customrecordlist to set showtitlerow. [Lineke]
* Changed display function of onetomanyrelation and manytomanyrelation to 
  correctly show data in csv export (without html). [Lineke]
* Use assignExportData function in your node to add extra data to the export.
  This makes it possible to do your own query and add extra info to the export.
  [Lineke]
* Made testreporter support finding and running the test for a single class,
  in ATK notation (module.mymodule.utils.utilclass) by using the 'class' 
  REQUEST variable. If found, the framework won't traverse
  the entire application, but just check for a testcase in the underlying
  testcases directory and load that testcase up.
  Example: test.php?class=atk.ui.atkpage which will load up 
  atk/ui/testcases/class.test_atkpage.inc. [Boy]
* Security: Fixed cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerability in Login screen and 
  any other screen that made use of the makeHiddenPostvars method. (bug #697) 
  [Ivo]
* It is only allowed to set the focus if the node allowes it. [dennisjan]
* Fixed OCI db driver unique constraint information in metadata (only use the
  unique flags for fields that are unique on their own). [Peter]
* Use createQuery on the node db instance to create a query object for unique field 
  set validation instead of using the default db instance. [Peter]
* atkManyToOneRelation::populate now support list of attribute names. [Peter]
* Bugfix in importhandler, mb_convert_encoding function is not always present.
  So we check if the function exists. [Lineke]
* Bugfix: atkMessageQueue messages are now also displayed in adminpages. [Ivo]
* Bugfix: atkformdata should be kept in the session because the window might 
  be forked. [Jeroen,Peter]
* Remember atktab in atkformdata because it might be changed in the current
  edit session. [Jeroen,Peter]
* Bugfix: atkQuery should enclose the FROM clause in parentheses due to changes
  in MySQL 5.0.15 to make MySQL more compliant with the standard. [Dennis]  
* Fixed issue in MySQL driver which caused connections to be re-used
  even though we connect to a different database. [Peter]
* Fixed some PHP5 notices. [Peter]
* Added getAttributes function to the atkStringParser, same as getFields but 
  if a relation is referenced using a dot only returns the attribute name 
  before the dot. [Sandy,Peter]
* Fixed bug in the atkFileAttribute that made Apache segfault when uploading
  2 or more files (and use a template). [Sandy,Peter]
- Temporarily removed the 'generate title row' checkbox in atkExportHandler as
  it isn't yet implemented. [Guido]
- Removed default theme's action_view.tpl as it basically is no difference 
  than the default action.tpl. [Ivo]
+ Added atkGetMimeTypeFromFileExtension to atkfiletools - to get the right 
  mimetype for the given filename. [Harrie]

  atkTableRenderer. [Guido]
+ Added reloadapp(); function which can be used to reload all the frames in
  the application. [Boy]
+ Added support for user-level language setting. [Boy]

  and remoteKey detection. The use of setRemoteKey and setLocalKey is no
  longer necessary if the foreign keys have the same name as the relation
  with _id appended to it. [Ivo]

  ability to cancel the selection of a record. [Guido]
+ Added ability to set the following password restrictions: minimum length,
  minimum number of uppercase characters, minimum number of lowercase
  charactes, minimum number of uppercase and lowercase characters together,
  number of numbers and the number of special characters. [Guido]
+ Added atkPasswordAttribute->generatePassword function which replaces the
  deprecated makePassword function. generatePassword is an object-function
  which generates passwords using the given length and restrictions set on
  the attribute. It is also possible to specify wheter the generated
  password should be easy to remember or as random as possible. [Guido]
+ Added Password forgotten option to allow users to regain access by asking
  the atk application to mail back a new password. To enable this feature,
  $config_auth_usernode, config_auth_emailfield and
  $config_auth_enablepasswordmailer should be set. (bug #471) [Guido]

  wildcards (*) in any search string. (bug #611) [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the mysql41 driver. The linkid wasn't cleared after closing
  the db connection which caused unexpected behaviour. [Martin]
* Significant performance enhancement in atkNode::searchDb(). Only string/text
  type fields are searched now. [Ivo]
* Rewrote theme engine, with the following improvements:
   + Full inheritance: themes can now derive from eachother so they only
     need to define the differences from the base theme.
   + Fully automatic theme structure scanning. Themedef.inc no longer needs
     to define which templates/styles/images etc. it implements. (bug #543)
   + Support for module specific theme files.
   + Supports themes in modules.
     ($config_defaulttheme = "modname.themename");
   * atkTheme/atkThemeCompiler codebase is about half as big.
   * Compiled themefiles are now better human readable.
   * Bug where "highlight" attribute definitions would not be loaded is
     fixed.
* When displaying an image with the atkFileAttribute a random number is added
  to the img src tag in order to prevent browser caching. [Wim]
* Changed the copydb method by filtering the executetriggers and added support
  for different modes. [Dennis-Jan, Peter]
* Introduced atkeditlng url variable which can be passed along to force ML
  attributes to display a specific language. [Boy]
* Fixed a bug in the 'remove current file' feature of atkFileAttribute when
  AF_FILE_PHYSICAL_DELETE was set. [Ivo]
* Fixed CSV import handler for date values and other complexer attribute
  types. (bug #502) [Ivo]

* Fixed php warning in atkMlNumberAttribute. [Ivo]
* Fixed error in triggerError method when atkLanguage was not imported. [Ivo]
* Fixed table definition of lesson 7 of the demo application. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug where postDelete trigger would be called twice. [Peter, Sandy]
* The preDelete trigger will now be called separately for each (to be)
  deleted record (instead of being called only once with the complete
  recordset). THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE! [Peter, Sandy]
* Fixed loading of the correct tab when 'atktab' is passed in the URL. [Boy]
* Fixed loading of tests from modules outside the application root which
  would sometimes do tests twice. [Boy]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations can now be properly hidden in forms.
  (bug #666) [Yury]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations now only retrieve those fields used
  in the descriptor and primary key. (bug #666) [Yury]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations no longer insert bogus records when
  the intermediary node had a separate primary key. (bug #338) [Ivo]
* Refactored atkManyBoolRelation's store(), hide(), searchCondition(),
  search() and isEmpty() methods to atkManyToManyRelation as these methods
  are not atkManyBoolRelation specific. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the atkManyToManyRelation when the filter isn't set. [Sandy]
* The atkdebugger is now passed an atkprevlevel of 0 instead of the
  originating atklevel (which caused it to lose its debugging info). [Boy]
* atkMLSplitter now uses atklng variable instead of deprecated lng variable.
  [Boy]
* Fixed atkBoolRelation; if unchecked, the value is 0 instead of NULL. [Sandy]
* Added baseclass include for the atkMockQuery. [Martin]
* Fixed a notice that users with Norton Internet Security or other popup
  blockers (that remove headers) may see. [Ivo]
* Link id is no longer passed to mysql error functions if it is null. [Boy]
* Fixed creating sequences in postgresql. [Sandy]
* Postgresql records are now fetched in PGSQL_ASSOC mode (only associative
  array instead of numerical indexes). This should save a lot of memory.
  For applications that rely on the numerical record indexes (EVIL!) you
  can set $config_pgsqlfetchmode = PGSQL_BOTH in your configfile. [Sandy]
* Replaced deprecated postgresql function calls with the correct calls. Note
  that the postgresql driver now requires PHP 4.2. (bug #349) [Thom]
* Added type="text/css" attribute to <style> tags. [Guido]
* Upgrade FCKEditor (for atkFckAttribute) to version 2.2. [Ivo, Olav]
+ Changed atkFckAttribute's HTML based resourcemanager into a PHP based
  version to support themes [Wim]

  destination attributes). Warning: this change might cause problems if
  you depend on the old (incorrect) behaviour! [Peter]
* Fixed reloading of descriptor fields for atkManyToOneRelations with a
  combined foreign key. [Guido]
* Added ability to call display on atkManyToOneRelation without mode. [Boy]
* The search bar now honors <attribname>_search() overrides in nodes.
  (bug #513) [Ivo]

* The title bar of add/edit action now only shows the last 2 master record
  descriptors to prevent the window from becoming too wide. [Ivo]
* Fixed distinct count support in atkQuery (using setDistinct). [Peter]
* Fixed the ability to place an attribute on multiple tabs using the
  array("tab1", "tab2") parameter. (bug #478) [Stefano]
* Fixed the width of forms inside tabs to be 100%, for 'outlook', 'win2k'
  and 'modern' themes. [Ivo]
* Fixed double cursor declaration in tabs css file of outlook theme. [Yury]
* Generated select/count queries now have spaces between the field- and
  table names for improved readability. Side effect is that the debugoutput
  no longer causes the screen to have an overly large scrollbar. [Ivo]
* Made the colorpicker popup multilanguage. [Sandy, Guido]
* Added extra is_array check to the display function the atkdateattribute
  because the empty function doesn't work correct in the php 5.0.5 version
  (this is fixed in the php 5.1.1 as far as i can see). [Sandy]
* Fixed include order in atkDateAttribute that could cause it to be
  displayed as a text input when included before atkAttribute. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the countDb that used wrong var in the in_array. [Sandy]
* Fixed MRA button translation when there is only one action. [Boy]
* If an MRA action is not allowed, it is removed from the list of selectable
  actions. (bug #390) [Ivo]

* Updated atkFileAttribute phpdoc, updated some deprecated elements and did
  some functional decomposition. [Boy]

* Fixed translation of links in atkAdminHandler. [Peter]
* Fixed a bug in the m2m relation that lacked passing the table name to the
  deleteDb() and therefor not being able to delete the record. [Martin]
* atkLanguage now transforms language param to lowercase, thus always
  expecting languagefile names and variable name to be lowercase. [Boy]
* atkUpdateAttribute now uses its parent display function to display its
  value. [Sandy]
* decodeKeyValueSet in atktools now also supports != operator. [Sandy]
* Fixed duplicates lookup which didn't work when replacing the first
  menuitem withing a submenu. [Guido]
* Fixed wrong title in confirmAction dialogs. [KevinLW]
* Replaced atk_var_dump of atkMessages with a single atkdebug statement in
  case there are no messages. [Guido]

  [Guido]
* Replaced usage of deprecated StringParse function by atkStringParser
  usage. [Guido]

* atkFramesMenu now passes along url and module name of item links to template
  and it now register menu.css (if available). [Boy]
* Moved the placeFocus() javascript call from the body to the globalLoad
  function. [Guido]
* The edit handler now also automatically places focus on the first input
  element available (similar to the add handler). [Guido]
* Replaced the formfocus.js script usage by a custom focus javascript in
  the formslogin page because the formfocus.js script only works on
  add/edit forms. [Guido]

  and ie. [Guido]
* HTML Forms should not have a margin above and below them by default.
  [Guido]
* Minor indentation adjustment of the generated HTML code. [Guido]
* Added the AF_NO_SORT flag by default to the atkParserAttribute as it
  should not be sortable. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atksearchhandler. Extended search crashed when using an
  atkDateAttribute.  [Peter, Dennis]
* Moved recordlist_orientation, recordlist_vorientation and recordlist_icons
  configuration values to theme, so instead of being defined as:
  $config_recordlist_orientation="left" it should be defined in the
  appropriate theme as $theme['recordlist_orientation']='left'. [Boy]
* Added AF_LIST_OBLIGATORY_NULL_ITEM flag to atkListAttribute. [Boy]
* Fixed DNS lookup in email validation in atkEmailAttribute. (bug #549) [Olav]

Changes in ATK 5.5
------------------
+ Added class atkMail for sending e-mails just like the normal mail function
  does, but with the ability to disable the sending of e-mails (and in the
  future send e-mails to other addresses etc.) for debugging purposes.
  [Peter]
+ Added support for configuration file overrides by other sections. [Peter]
+ Made atkErrorHandler put notices and php5 strict errors into the atk debug
  log so developers can see them. [Guido]
+ Added validate() method to atkDateTimeAttribute so both the date and time
  parts can be validated upon input. [Lineke]
+ Flags for the atkDateTimeAttribute are now also passed to its internal
  atkDateAttribute and the atkTimeAttribute. [Lineke]
+ Added setForceUpdate() method to atkAttribute to force update of its value
  upon save. [Boy]
+ Added 'mock' database drivers for testing purposes. [Boy]
+ Added atkMockNode to emulate a node, for testing purposes. [Ivo]
+ Added atkTestCase baseclass for unittests, that features the ability to
  replace database connections, nodes and the securitymanager with mock
  objects. [Ivo, Boy]
+ Added ability to pass ?atkmodule=modname to test.php to run only the tests
  of a specified module. [Ivo]
+ Added addFallbackModule() method to atkLanguage. [Ivo]
+ Added collapsible groups feature to atkProfileAttribute. [Harrie]
+ Added 'select all/select none' buttons per group in atkProfileAttribute.
  [Harrie]
+ Added tab security. It is now possible to grant/prevent access to a single
  tab of a node. [Harrie]
+ Added atkSetNode() counterpart for atkGetNode(), to set nodes to a different
  instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added atkSetSecurityManager() counterpart for atkGetSecurityManager(), to set
  the securitymanager to a different instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added flag AF_RELATION_NO_NULL_ITEM for atkManyToOneRelation to hide the
  select_none option. [Dennis]
+ The {atktext} smarty plugin now features parsing in arbitrary values into a
  translation by passing the translated string to a stringparser. [Ivo]
+ Added flag AF_MANYBOOL_AUTOLINK to atkManyBoolRelation which shows an add
  link which can be used to add records to the referenced node (if the user
  is allowed to do so). [Guido]
+ Added translations for critical and unknown errors. [Guido]
+ Added convenience methods text() to atkNode and atkAttribute. [Ivo, Peter]
+ Added $config["automenu"] for meta module. If set to false, the meta module
  does not add any default menuitems. Defaults to true. [Ivo]
+ atkNode now has built-in detection of trigger reruns, so even if triggers
  such as postAdd are called twice, it only runs on the first call. [Ivo]
+ Added $config_auth_changerealm to influence whether http authentication
  should change its realm to allow logout. [ChristianH, Ivo]
+ Added the ability to reset a database connection. [Boy]
* The atkNode constructor's $type parameter is now optional and defaults to
  the class name. [Ivo]
* Several parts of ATK now make use of the new atkNode::text() method, to
  support node overridable texts. [Sandy, Ivo]
* Replaced numerous deprecated text() calls with atktext(). [Guido, Lineke]
* Fixed numerous php notices. [Guido, Ivo]
* Fixed PHP pre-4.2.x support by not using the session_cache_expire function
  if not present. Minimum requirement is now PHP 4.1. [Guido]
* Code improvement of pre/post triggers. Also preAdd() is now properly called
  from the addDb() method. [Martin]
* Moved the modifier calling functionality to atkModule. This makes it
  possible to implement a generic modifier in a module that can handle any
  node from any module. [Ivo, Guido]
* If an action has no html output, the dispatcher no longer renders an html
  page. This reduces some overhead on output-less actions such as save/update/
  delete. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the search functionality of the atkManyBoolRelation. [Stefano]
* Fixed translation for the title of the 'select' action. [Lineke]
* Passed along atkprevlevel to debugger window so the stack doesn't get forked
  causing the console window to draw a blank page. [Boy]
* If no link_select_node translation is found atkManyToOneRelation tries a
  generic translation of 'select_a' followed by the node name. [Boy]
* If no title_module translation is found, atkProfileAttribute will use
  the module name itself as translation. [Ivo]
* If extended searching is called directly the resultlist is nested in the
  session so after editing we return directly to the results. [Boy]
* atkTimeAttribute now properly distinguishes between '0:00' hours and empty
  values. [Ivo]
* Fixed a stylesheet problem when using Internet Explorer; the font size and
  color of clickable recordlist headers would change when hovering over them
  with the mousepointer. [Guido]
* Fixed a bug in atkAtttribute's setTabs() method. [Peter]
* getNode() is now called atkGetNode to be more consistent with naming
  convention. (getNode() is still present as deprecated function). [Ivo]
* Bugfix in atkListAttribute: All quotes in options are now replaced with
  &quot;. [Lineke]
* Bugfix in atkMultiSelectattribute: always add escapeSql to value in
  checkbox. [Lineke]
* The 'view' action now uses atkNode's getFormButtons() method to get the
  appropriate buttons. [Lineke]
* Fixed a bug when hiding an atkBoolAttribute. [Lineke]
* When a new search is performed in a recordlist, the screen now jumps to
  the first page. [Lineke]
* Fixed several issues in LDAP authentication. [Lineke]
* Added the ability to add additional headers to a page rendered with atkPage.
  [Lineke]
* Fixed a Smarty regular expression to support '0 params'. [Lineke]
* Fixed a bug in Smarty's core.read_cache_file.php. More information:
  http://www.phpinsider.com/smarty-forum/viewtopic.php?t=4188&highlight=
  smartytplfunc. [Lineke]
* Fixed AF_UNIQUE check in atkNodeValidator (used postvars instead of record
  for validation). [Peter]
* Fixed some outlook tree icons that were corrupted. [Lineke]
* Recordlist icon names are now assumed to be lowercase. [Ivo]
* atkTheme attributes are now case insensitive. [Ivo]
* atkOneToManyRelation now builds the referential where clause in a separate
  overridable method _getLoadWhereClause(). [Ivo]
* Using single quotes in smarty tags is now allowed. [Lineke]
* Fixed security issue in atkProfileAttribute. Users can no longer grant
  privileges they don't have themeselves. [Harrie, Guido]
* atkNode::getTabs can now handle actions without tabs. [Ivo]
* Cleaned up the atkSecurityManager constructor. [Ivo]
* atkManyToOneRelation now uses primary key field as default order if no order
  was specified. [Lineke]
* The edit screen now remembers the tab the user was on for the current record
  (used to be record-independent). [Lineke]
* Fixed translation of atkDateAttribute when the current language was changed
  at runtime. [Ivo]
* Fixed memory leak with debugger set at level 2 where session would be
  stuffed with debug data. [Boy,Sandy]
* Reduced memory consumption of traces by replacing &nbsp; with plain space
  as the preformat tag already takes care of proper formatting. [Guido]
* Fixed html tag delimiters ('<' and '>') in traces being interpreted
  by the browser when present in atk_get_trace("html") output. Now they
  are replaced by html entities (&gt; and &lt; respectively). [Guido]
* Fixed various javascript errors related to showtab which sometimes
  resulted in all tabs being displayed as active. [Guido]
* Fixed cross-browser cursor behaviour when hovering over tabs. [Guido]
* Upgraded tbsooo opendocument parser from version 0.7.7 to 0.7.8. [Guido]
* Added htmlentities to atkNode's actionTitle function. [Sandy]
* Fixed (extended) searching in atkOneToManyRelations. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed translation of html entities in other charsets. [Yury]
* Changed longdate format for atkDateAttribute (does no longer contain the
  weekday by default). [Guido]
* Fixed selection of the interface language in the atkFCKAttribute. [Guido]
* Fixed warning generated when interpreting a NULL value in the
  atkDateTimeAttribute. [Guido]
* Fixed HTML typo (<a/> instead of </a>) in dispatch.php. [Guido]
* Changed permission_action translation in atkProfileAttribute to use the
  atktext fallback feature. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in Oracle demo installation file (lesson6_deparment table). [Ivo]
* Fixed hardcoded translations in atkFileAttribute. [Ivo]
* Mentioned PHP5 requirement for mysql41 driver in the config file. [Ivo]
* Bugfix when using a filter on an attribute with the same name as the table.

Note: The CHANGES file has not been accurately updated until the release of
ATK 5.0. The changes below are rough feature indications.

Changes in ATK 4.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 4 was the PHP4 release of ATK. The light version was the version that has
accompanied Achievo (http://www.achievo.org) from approx. 0.6 to 1.1, and was
not publically available outside of Achievo. A detailed changelog has not
been kept. Most changes can be traced back to entries in Achievo's CHANGES
file.

Changes in ATK 3.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 3 was the first publicly available release, but only as part of
Achievo. based on PHP3. All was new, so a list of changes is not present.
