* Fixed atkNumberAttribute's search field, size is not limitted anymore to
  the size of the maximum allowed value which makes it possible again to
  enter ranges for the search. [Peter]

  similar to the preAddToEditArray methods but is invoked when creating
  the view array for the view handler. [Peter]
