Changes in ATK 6.2
------------------
+ Added atkCache, see http://www.achievo.org/wiki/ATK_Cache. [Sandy]
+ Added the atkDataGrid which replaces atkRecordList for the admin and
  select handlers and the atkOneToManyRelation. The atkDataGrid allows
  browsing through records without page reloads. [Peter]
+ Added atkConsoleController for creating standardized console scripts. [Vito]
+ Added a new theme called stillblue, which is based on steelblue but with
  more workspace and frameless [Erik]
+ Added support for caching of the meta node code. This makes the meta node
  just as fast as an ordinary node. Caching is automatically turned on for meta
  nodes which either don't have a meta method defined or have their meta method
  defined as being static. During development the caching can be turned of
  by setting the new $config_meta_caching configuration option to false. [Peter]
+ Added the atkMetaCompiler which transforms the meta policy contents to code.
  If you want to use your own compiler class you can override the new
  $config_meta_compiler configuration option. [Peter]
+ Added support for setting the default value for meta node attributes using
  atkMetaPolicy's new setDefaultValue method. [Peter]
+ Added support for forcing the insertion of meta node attributes using
  atkMetaPolicy's new setForceInsert/removeForceInsert methods. [Peter]
+ Added support for setting a handler/callback for the atkMetaPolicy which
  should be called instead of the meta node's meta method, this supercedes
  the atkMetaHandler class. You can set the handler for a node by specifying
  it as a meta option either by passing it to the parent constructor or
  creating a protected instance variable called $handler. [Peter]
+ Added support for caching database table meta data. This is in addition
  to the atkMetaNode caching. [Martin]
+ Added atkPageBuilder (can be instantiated using $node->createPageBuilder())
  which provides a fluent interface for building generalized ATK pages.
  [Peter]
+ Added atkFieldSet attribute which can be used to combine attributes in
  edit/view mode. [Peter]
+ Added atkManyToManySelectRelation, a new variant of the many to many relation
  which allows you to add items to the relation using auto-completion. Useful
  for many-to-many relations which have many selectable options. [Peter]
+ Added atkRadioDetailsAttribute, displays radio buttons with options to choose
  from just like the atkRadioAttribute but allows you to use other attributes
  for detail selections once certain options are selected. [Peter]  
+ Added support for custom actions to the atkManyToManySelectRelation, also
  added the posibility to define a custom relation class for hasMany relations.
  [Erik,Peter]
+ Added a way to set a limit to the amount of elements that will be returned
  with the atkShuttle attribute. [Erik]
+ Added a function setUseThousandsSeparator to enable the thousandsseparator
  when display the number. Default no thousandsseperator is displayed. [Martijn]
+ The atkNumberAttribute and atkCurrency now supports the thousands separator.
  It's possible to add a number with a thousand seperator included. According
  to the language settings the number is converted to right format.
  The functions standardiseSeparator and translateSeparator in
  atkNumberAttribute are deprecated. [Martijn]
+ Added year sorting on the atkDateAttribute. Use setYearSorting()
  to change the sorting order of the years dropdown. [Martijn]
+ Added simple mode on the atkDateAttribute. With the simple mode enabled
  no javascript is used to update the dropdowns [Martijn]
+ atkFileEditor is now able to browse through subdirectories. [Bjorn]
+ Added support for muliple dependant attributes in a radiodetails attribute
  and added support for labels for the detail attributes. [Tjeerd]
+ Added support for destination filters in atkManyToManySelectRelation. [Tjeerd]
+ Added the ability to use multiple atkFrontControllers by defining a different
  uri key in the atkFrontController tag. This is done as shown in the following
  example: {atkfrontcontroller uri_param=myuri myuri="/module/control/action"}
  [Erik]
+ Added setNextId, nextid, clearNextId on atkMockDb to simulate nextid
  functionality [Martijn]
+ Added addFields on atkQuery to add multiple fields (with values) at once.
  [Martijn]
+ Allow setting ownerfields for ManytoMany relations [Erik, Peter]
+ Added atkEcho() function for making echo output only from cron. [Yury]
+ Added support for searching with a '/' as seperator for from/to values in a
  free text search for atkDateAttribute. [Tjeerd, Peter]
+ Added node, nodetitle, action and actiontitle as separate entries to
  the stack-trace array. (Achievo Bug 942) [Peter]
+ Added support for objects tat implement the ArrayAccess interface in
  atkStringParser and don't threat strings as an array anymore. [Peter]
+ atkCountryAttribute now has a new list type called "custom", this custom
  list can be customised by calling the new method "setList" with as parameter
  a array of country iso codes. After setting the list you can just request
  the custom list like you would with the "world" or "europe" list.
  [Erik]
+ Added unregister_style() method to atkPage to unregister a stylesheet.
  [Tjeerd]
+ atkBoolAttribute now uses getLabel for displaying it's label if it uses the
  AF_BOOL_INLINE_LABEL flag. [Tjeerd]
+ atkAttribute's HTML input box now has an id attribute by default. [Tjeerd]
+ atkCountryAttribute now includes a world shortlist that includes US+EU15
  [Erik]
+ Adding to atkaggregatedcolumn support using relation field as searching
  field. [Yury]
+ Took the file error check out of the validate function so that it can be
  called statically from outside of atkfileattribute. It returns the
  corresponding error. fetchFileErrorType($_FILES[0]['error']) [Erik]
+ Initial values are now filled as well for the destination of an
  atkOneToOnerelation during a call to initial_values. [Tjeerd,Peter]
+ Added support for image mime type validation in the atkfileattribute. [Martin]
+ Do display PHP Fatal errors when debugging is on. [Peter, Tjeerd]
+ Add 'NOT IN' and '&' to node->valiadateFilter(), so it can be used in filter
  from now. [Yury]
+ Adding getAvailableIndices() to atknavigator, so it display only available
  letter now. (bug #714) [Yury]
+ Added atkindex to $pageVars - it contain current index letter. [Yury]
+ Added 'clear_index' and 'clear_search' link to navigator, so we can clear
  search and index creteria separately. [Yury]
+ Add NF_EDITAFTERCOPY flag and handling of 'editcopy'actions - record coping
  and open for editing. (bug #524) [Yury]
+ Added ATK wrapper of the PHP iconv function - atk_iconv. Check if iconv
  function is present in the system. If yes - use it for converting string, if
  no - save string untouch and make warning about it. [Yury]
+ Added support for dialog render mode for atkViewHandler and atkAdminHandler.
  [Peter]
+ For the atkFckAttribute it is now possible to load an additional configuration
  file where you can override some of the default settings. [Tjeerd, Dennis]  
+ The attributename and nodename are now available in the editform.tpl and
  viewform.tpl templates. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Access denied pages of dialogs now also have a close button. [Dennis]
+ When registering a menuitem, the enabled parameter now also supports a
  callback function to determine wether a menu item should be enabled.
  [Peter, Dennis]
+ The fuzzyfilters in atkNode now also support the [table] string that parsed by
  the atkStringParser. [Peter, Dennis]
+ In the atkOneToManyRelation it is now possible to disable the use of
  destinationFilters when going to the add or edit action of the destination
  node. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added the method atkNvl() to use the value of the first given argument that is
  not null. [Peter, Dennis]
+ All theme templates can now be overridden per module. [Sandy, Ivo]
+ Added AF_BOOL_INLINE_LABEL flag to display a label next to the checkbox.
  [Peter]
+ Added support for file extension validation in atkFileAttribute. [Peter]
+ Added the methods setColorMode() and getColorMode() for the
  atkColorPickerAttribute to make the colorpicker validation check based on the
  setting of the colormode. For now only two modes are supported:
  CP_COLORMODE_DEFAULT (default behaviour) and CP_COLORMODE_HEX6 (Only hex
  notations with 6 characters are valid). Also added testcase for the
  atkColorPickerAttribute. [Dennis]
+ The submit-handling of a the javascript method atkMRASubmit() can be
  overridden by proving a javascript method with the name atkMRA_<action>. Where
  action is the name of the action you wish to override. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added method nodeTitle() to atkUI. It supports the same functionality as the
  title() method, but supports providing an object instead an atkNodeType.
  [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added method setEditFieldPrefix and getEditFieldPrefix to the atknode class.
  ATK now supports a default fieldprefix for all fields. This can be set in
  2 ways: the setEditFieldPrefix for a specific node or the
  $config_edit_fieldprefix for the complete ATK application. [Lineke]
+ Added $config_auth_loginpage option. For applications that do not
  want to use the atk login form or the htaccess box the config variable can
  contain an url to redirect to instead of displaying the login form of ATK.
  [Lineke]
+ Added scripts/ directory which contains utility scripts for building ATK
  applications. [Peter]

  atkMockDb. [Dennis]
+ Added feature to specify which attributes you want to export. [Sandy]
+ Added manual paint feature to atkAttribute. Manually painted attributes will
  not be rendered. If this is set to true, you are responsible for calling
  the attribute's edit() method to paint it on screen. [Ivo, Sandy]
+ Added setText function to atkDummyAttribute to change the text. [Sandy]
+ Added setClickableLabel to the atkRadioAttribute to turn it of
  (default this is on). [Sandy]
+ Added validation of tags, they may not contain HTML or linefeeds. Also
  added testcase for validation. [Dennis]
+ Added atkTextAttribute::setWrapMode to specify the wrap mode for
  the textarea (by default "soft"). [Peter]
+ Added support for specifying the character set for the atkOci9Db driver. 
  [Peter]

  implementing a modifyDialog method. [Peter]
+ Added support for specifying more dialog window options on a per-theme basis
  by setting the new theme attribute 'dialog_window_options'. [Peter]
+ Added support for dynamically loading stylesheets (for Ajax requests). [Peter]
+ Added $config_application_dir which can be used to separate ATK from your

  dir if it doesn't exist.
  Please check: http://www.achievo.org/wiki/AtkDocumentWriter for tips and
  limitations [Jeroen]
+ Added addHeader support to atkPage. [Peter]

  somewhere inside your ATK root e.g. {include file="ui:modules/..."} [Peter]
+ Added atkcontroller var which can be used to load a custom controller. 
  [Maurice]
+ Added atkClassLoader::mountClassPath($prefix, $path) which makes it
  possible to mount paths outside the atkroot inside the class loader using
  a special prefix. [Peter]
+ Added Canadian French translation (cf.lng). [MartinR]
* atkFrontController will now register scripts and styles in child
  controllers after the main controller [Harrie]  
* Improved recordlist icon searching, an icon can now be prefixed with
  a module or module and node to make it possible to have different actions
  for the same action name for different nodes. [Peter]
* Fixed correct insertion of null values in atkFixtureManager (mainly used
  for test-cases which use a test-database / fixtures) [Peter]

  directly added to the selected records now. [Patrick]
* Fixed bug that caused FCK editor to loose it's changes when the user 
  switched tabs. [Peter]
* Save button for add action is now called "Save and close" instead of "Save".

  class which makes it possible to style it differently. [Peter]
* In formfocus.js, the inital text selection is cleared to prevent data loss
  on a key event. [Patrick]
* Oci8 and Oci9 drivers now support substring conditions for subqueries.
  [Peter]
* Improved early state detection of sections to get a smooth display when
  showing a tab with opened/closed sections. [Peter]
* partial_url now supports a $sessionStatus parameter so that partial URLs
  can also be executed in a separate session stack using SESSION_NEW [Peter]
* Dialogs are now executed in a separate session stack. [Peter]
* Improved order of items in partial page output; stylesheets are now
  loaded first, then script files, then the content (including possible

* Added empty string check at the atkMlSplitter for primary key values that
  cannot be NULL and made the language key always uppercase [Yannick]
* Upgraded Prototype to 1.6.0.2, Scriptaculous to 1.8.1 and Window.js to
  1.3.2. Might cause certain backwards incompatiblities! [Peter]

  initlally rendering the shuttle. [Peter]
* Did some internal refactoring on the atkDateAttribute draw method. [Martijn]
* Fixed pda format in atkDateAttribute. [Martijn]
* Improved page title support which makes it possible to set the title of
  the page from within an action. [Peter]
* Added a display method to the atkprofileattribute, it will now list the
  rights that a user has per node and module. [Erik]
* Added a getMenu method to the atkdropdownmenu. The method simply calls and
  return $this->load(). [Erik]
* Fixed issue with O2M relation and persistent filters. [Tjeerd/Peter]
* Added support for setting a field separator on the multiselectattrib.
  This allows the attribute to be used with the mysql set datatype. [Martin]
* Fixed SQL error in extended search with atkNumberAttributes. [Martin]
* Minor speedup in atkimport and changed file_exists to is_readable which makes
  more sense [mvdvelden]
* Added setDir() to the fileattrib which allows setting the dir path
  after initialisation. Due to some issues with metanode caching the path
  was parsed incorrectly in the cached file. Set the path in postMeta()
  will resolve the issue but it still needs to be fixed in the metanode
  compiler. [Martin]
* Fixed the exact search mode when using the atknumberattribute. It now uses
  the equal operator correctly for exact number searches. [Martin]

  in the configfile [PeterB]
* Fixed bug in atktestcase, when using a test database the normal database
  would be emptied. [Lineke]

* Fixed issue with ordering in recordlist when multiple ordercolumns were
  specified. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed a possible error situation in Smarty, which caused fatal errors on some
  occasions. This was caused by a &nbsp; directly after an open tag, added 
  there for example by the FCK Editor. [Peter,Tjeerd]
* Improved atkCountryAttribute's world_countries_shortlist. [Erik]
* Added html entities to the country definitions in atkCountryAttribute and
  html_decode them before putting them in the array so that it should contain
  the right character. [Erik]
* A test will now fail if a specified class cannot be found. [Peter]
* Refactored atkDateAttribute a bit, so we don't need the include.php file to
  register it's javascript. This makes the use of class.atkdateattribute.js.inc
  deprecated. Also added a call to the onChange handler for the input field if
  the AF_DATE_STRING flag is used. [Tjeerd,Peter]

* Fixed decode in atkcustomrecordlist. [Yury]
* Added missing seconds to function atkDateTimeAttribute.datetimeArray().
  [Patrick]
* Fixed removing a file with the atkfileattribute when using the attribute on
  one2one child node. [Martin]
* To calculate a UTC offset you also need the datetime next to the timezone
  because of DST differences. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed atkMetaPolicy::_applyAttribute(), setting attribute flag using 
  setTypeAndParams and addFlags methods together.(bug #889) [Yury]
* Prevent registeration of atkAttribute's onChangehandler more than one time 
  and move constant part out of cycle. [Yury]
* Added atkAttrRowHidden style to steelblue theme. [Yury]
