Note: The CHANGES file has not been accurately updated until the release of
ATK 5.0. The changes below are rough feature indications.
 
Changes in ATK 4.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 4 was the PHP4 release of ATK. The light version was the version that has
accompanied Achievo (http://www.achievo.org) from approx. 0.6 to 1.1, and was
not publically available outside of Achievo. A detailed changelog has not
been kept. Most changes can be traced back to entries in Achievo's CHANGES
file.

Changes in ATK 3.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 3 was the first publicly available release, but only as part of 
Achievo. based on PHP3. All was new, so a list of changes is not present.
